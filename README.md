# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
Project-1
Project YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing involves collecting and storing vast amounts of data from YouTube, one of the largest video sharing platforms in the world. This data is extracted and may be used for numerous purposes, such as market research, trend analysis, user behavior understanding, and targeted advertising.

The first step in the project is to develop a robust data harvesting system that can efficiently collect data from YouTube. This includes gathering information about videos, channels, viewership statistics, comments, likes, and other relevant metrics. The system must be capable of handling massive amounts of data in real-time, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a MongoDB database, migrates it to a SQL data warehouse, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app. Here are the key features of my project:

ðŸ”¹ YouTube Data Collection: By providing a valid channel ID, you can retrieve detailed information about a YouTube channel, including channel details, video details, and comments.

ðŸ”¹ MongoDB Integration: The collected data can be seamlessly migrated and stored in MongoDB for further analysis and processing.

ðŸ”¹ PostgreSQL Migration: The data from MongoDB can be migrated to a PostgreSQL database, enabling powerful querying capabilities and data manipulation.

ðŸ”¹ Streamlit Dashboard: The interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to input channel IDs, fetch channel data, and perform data migration operations with ease.
